## Comprender el Editor de Unity

<br>
<br>

### Overview 
* Unity Editor is a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) that allows game developers to create, design, and deploy games across multiple platforms, including VR (Virtual Reality) platforms. Here is a detailed description of the basic concepts and features of the Unity Editor, with a particular emphasis on VR development



<br>

### The Unity Interface
<p>The Unity interface is the main workspace where you can access all the tools and features of the editor. The interface consists of various windows, including the Scene View, Game View, Hierarchy, Inspector, Project, and Console. These windows can be rearranged and customized to suit your needs.</p>

<br>

### Scenes
<p>A scene in Unity is a collection of game objects, lights, cameras, and other components that make up a level or area of your game. You can create and manage multiple scenes within a single project.</p>

<br>


### Game Objects
<p>A game object is the basic unit of a scene in Unity. It represents any object in your game, such as a character, a weapon, or an environment asset. Game objects can be customized by adding components, such as colliders, scripts, and particle systems.</p>

<br>

### Components
<p>Components are reusable pieces of code that you can attach to game objects to add functionality. Some examples of components include Rigidbody, Collider, Audio Source, and VR Camera. Components can be created and customized using C#.</p>

<br>

### Scripts
<p>Scripts are written in C# and provide the logic and behavior for game objects. Scripts can be attached to game objects as components, and they can interact with other components and objects in the scene.</p>
